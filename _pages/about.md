Hi, I am Yajie Gu, a fourth-year PhD student in Vision, Graphics and Learning Research Group (VGL) at University of York, UK, supervised by [Nick Pears](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/nick-pears). I am working on 3D images analysis, partically on dense correspondence and its applications, 3D human face modelling and generative models. I am interested in high quality 3D shape representations, especially in a continuous field.
